# Digit-recognition
Implementing a neural network to classify MNIST digits.

         
Setup:

Used Python's NumPy numerical library for handling arrays and array operations; used matplotlib for producing figures and plots.

Note on software: For all the projects, we will use python 3.6 augmented with the NumPy numerical toolbox, the matplotlib plotting toolbox. For This project, we will also be using PyTorch for implementing the Neural Nets and scipy to handle sparse matrices.

Download mnist.tar.gz and untar it in to a working directory. The archive contains the various data files in the Dataset directory, along with the following python files:

part2-nn/neural_nets.py  to implement neural net from scratch
part2-mnist/nnet_fc.py  used PyTorch to classify MNIST digits
part2-mnist/nnet_conv.py used convolutional layers to boost performance
part2-twodigit/mlp.py and part2-twodigit/conv.py which are for a new, more difficult version of the MNIST dataset
